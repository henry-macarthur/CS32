* Any time you have a pointer to some derived type, but need a pointer to the base object, c++ automaticallt makes that conversion
* for anything we want to be aopplicable to all derived types, we should add it to the base class
* If we do not add the implementation of a certain function or variable from the base class, then it is automatically Inherited from the base class
    * INHERITANCE
* If we make an array of type shape, but we want to call a specific shapeâ€™s implementation of a shape funtion, the compiler does converion for us
    * Will convert the shape pointer to they right derived shape class
* Cannot access derived class specific functions or datamembers that do not exist in the base class
    * Ex, when we make a array of shapes, we cannot access the radius of each item beacuse not every item has a radius
* If a compiler has to make a desicion about which implementaion to use, it default uses the base class implementation
* //Pass items by reference or by pointer because you loose info if you pass by value
* derived classes can have virtual function
* if we forget to declare the implementation of virtual functions in the derived classes, then the class becomes a abstract class
* Trying to delete a derived object from a base pointer is undefined behavior if the deconstructor is not virtual
* If a class is designed as a base class, declare its deconstuctor as virtual and implement it!!
